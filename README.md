# fit-BEL
End-to-end code to estimate AGN properties from a single spectrum by fitting a Broad Emission Line (BEL)

### Tasks
- [ ] Adapt the [original code](https://github.com/AleD1996/diana_et_al_2021) to a single script: 
    - [x] Basic spectrum plot
    - [x] Add interval selection procedure
    - [x] Add continuum fit procedure
    - [x] Add mask selection procedure
    - [x] Add fit selection procedure
    - [x] Add parameters estimation
    - [ ] Refactor the code to allow models modularity
    - [ ] Add error estimate procedure
    
### Bugs
- [x] Fix the zoom reset
- [x] Fix the masks re-draw
- [ ] Fix FWHM calculation

### New features
- [ ] Add different file formats in addition to `.fits` and `.txt`
- [ ] Add different fit components in addition to gaussian ones.
